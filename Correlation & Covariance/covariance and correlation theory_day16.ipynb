    "### 1. What is covariance and what does it measure in a dataset?\n",
    "- **Covariance** measures how two variables **change together** in a dataset.  \n",
    "- If both variables tend to increase together, covariance is **positive**.  \n",
    "- If one increases while the other decreases, covariance is **negative**.  \n",
    "- **Limitation:** Its value depends on the units of the variables, so it’s hard to interpret the strength of the relationship.\n",

    "### 2. What is correlation and how is it different from covariance?\n",
    "- **Correlation** measures both the **strength** and **direction** of a linear relationship between two variables.  \n",
    "- Unlike covariance, correlation is **standardized**, so it always lies between **-1 and +1**.  \n",

    "### 4. What does a positive covariance mean?\n",
    "- A **positive covariance** means that **both variables tend to increase or decrease together**.  \n",
    "- Example: Height and weight – generally, taller people weigh more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What does a negative correlation represent in real-world data?\n",
    "- A **negative correlation** means that **when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease**.  \n",
    "- Example: The number of hours spent watching TV and exam scores – usually, more TV hours → lower scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Why is covariance not normalized?\n",
    "- Covariance is **not normalized** because it depends on the units of the variables.  \n",
    "- This makes it hard to compare across datasets with different scales.  \n",
    "- Correlation fixes this by **scaling covariance** with standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Can correlation exist without causation? Explain with an example.\n",
    "- **Yes**, correlation does **not imply causation**.  \n",
    "- Two variables can move together **by coincidence or due to a third factor**, without one causing the other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Ice cream sales and drowning incidents are positively correlated (both increase in summer), but buying ice cream **does not cause drowning**.  \n",
    "- The third factor (summer/temperature) affects both.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What does a correlation value close to 0 indicate?\n",
    "- A correlation close to **0** means **no linear relationship** between the two variables.  \n",
    "- Changes in one variable **do not predict** changes in the other.  \n",
    "- Example: Shoe size and exam scores – they are basically unrelated.\n"
