    "###  5 Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity (Straight-line relationship):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The relationship between X and Y should be a **straight line**.\n",
    "   * **Example:** The hotter it is, the more ice cream is sold. As temperature rises, sales rise in a straight pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independent errors (Mistakes don’t affect each other):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Prediction mistakes today should **not affect** mistakes tomorrow.\n",
    "   * **Example:** If we predict 100 ice creams today but actually sell 105, it shouldn’t change tomorrow’s prediction mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity (Mistakes are similar size):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The differences between actual and predicted values (**errors**) should be about the same for all X values.\n",
    "   * **Example:** Whether it’s 20°C or 35°C, the prediction error in ice cream sales should be roughly similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality of errors (Mistakes mostly small):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Most prediction mistakes should be **small**, with only a few being large, forming a bell-shaped pattern.\n",
    "   * **Example:** Usually, we predict ice cream sales close to reality, but occasionally, we may be a little off.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No multicollinearity (X’s are different):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Independent variables should **not be too similar** to each other.\n",
    "   * **Example:** Don’t use both “house size” and “number of rooms” if they are almost the same, because they give repeated information.\n",

    "  1. The model **learns faster**\n",
