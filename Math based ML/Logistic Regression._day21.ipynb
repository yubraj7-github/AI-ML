    "### Binary Classification \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Binary classification is a machine learning task in which data is classified into **two possible classes only**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "In binary classification, the model learns from given data and predicts one of two outcomes such as **Yes/No**, **True/False**, or **0/1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Email spam detection is a binary classification problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spam → **1**\n",
    "* Not Spam → **0**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the model decides whether an email belongs to **spam or not spam**, which are only two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "Thus, binary classification involves assigning data to exactly **two distinct categories**.\n",

    "# Sigmoid Function \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "The sigmoid function is an S-shaped function that converts any real number into a value **between 0 and 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**  \n",
    "sigma(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavior:**  \n",
    "- If x → +∞, sigma(x) ≈ 1 → output close to 1  \n",
    "- If x → -∞, sigma(x) ≈ 0 → output close to 0  \n",
    "- If x = 0, sigma(x) = 0.5 → output is in the middle  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-Life Example:**  \n",
    "- **Email Spam Detection:**  \n",
    "  - Suppose a model calculates a score x = 3 for an email.  \n",
    "  - sigma(3) ≈ 0.95 → 95% probability the email is spam → likely “Yes, Spam”  \n",
    "  - If x = -2, sigma(-2) ≈ 0.12 → 12% probability → likely “No, Not Spam”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "- Sigmoid is widely used in **binary classification** problems.  \n",
    "- It **converts any number into a probability between 0 and 1**, helping in decisions like Yes/No, True/False, or Spam/Not Spam.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Log-loss, also called **Binary Cross-Entropy**, is a loss function used in **binary classification** to measure how well a model's predicted probabilities match the actual labels.  \n",
    "- Lower log-loss → better predictions  \n",
    "- Higher log-loss → worse predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**  \n",
    "For a single example:  \n",
    "LogLoss = - [y * log(p) + (1 - y) * log(1 - p)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "- y = actual label (0 or 1)  \n",
    "- p = predicted probability of y = 1  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavior:**  \n",
    "- If the model predicts **1 for actual 1** → loss is small  \n",
    "- If the model predicts **0 for actual 1** → loss is large  \n",
    "- It **penalizes wrong predictions more if the model is confident**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-Life Example:**  \n",
    "**Email Spam Detection:**  \n",
    "- Suppose an email is actually spam (y = 1)  \n",
    "- Model predicts p = 0.9 → Log-loss = -[1 * log(0.9) + 0 * log(0.1)] ≈ 0.105 → good prediction  \n",
    "- Model predicts p = 0.1 → Log-loss = -[1 * log(0.1) + 0 * log(0.9)] ≈ 2.302 → bad prediction  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "- Log-loss is used to **evaluate probability predictions in binary classification**.  \n",
    "- Lower log-loss means the **model's predicted probabilities are closer to actual outcomes**.\n"
